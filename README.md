# AI-Poem-Generation
This program runs in the shell and generates shakespeare-like poems based on inputs from the user. 

The user has the option to either generate a new model with their choice of a sequence length and step size, or use the existing model stored in memory (the model is in the writepoems.model folder and the sequence length and step size are stored in the memory.txt file)

HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM:
Simply download the files and run main.py
1. Open your terminal
2. Navigate to the directory the project has been downloaded or cloned to
3. enter the command "python3 main.py" (note: this is assuming you have python 3 downloaded)
